Files in this (build-frameworks) directory are assumed unchanged because Apple Silicon users will change the files and there is no need to commit the changes for everyone. It is a quirk of Cosmos.framework.
If you NEED to change something here reverse this command:

git update-index --assume-unchanged $(git ls-files | tr '\n' ' ')
